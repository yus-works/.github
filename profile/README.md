# Hello!

I'm a software engineer who enjoys building tools and exploring interesting
tech problems. This is where I keep my notable projects, the ones I'm proud of
and actively maintain.

**Contact:** [teodor@yus.rs](mailto:teodor@yus.rs) | [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/teodord25)

You can find my other experiments and contributions on my [personal GitHub](https://github.com/teodord25).

Here's what I've been working on:

## Projects

### [Yus.rs](https://github.com/yus-works/yus)
My personal site built entirely in Rust (including the frontend!). Features
WebGPU/WebGL2 graphics demos and runs WebAssembly in the browser. No JavaScript
needed.

### [Job Watcher](https://github.com/yus-works/job-watcher)
Got tired of checking multiple job boards, so I built a Go service that
aggregates them all in one place. Clean, fast, and actually useful.

### [csc.nvim](https://github.com/yus-works/csc-nvim)
A Neovim plugin that autocompletes commit scopes by learning from your repo's
history. Makes conventional commits less annoying.

### [HTTP from TCP](https://github.com/yus-works/tcp-to-http)
Built an HTTP server from scratch using raw TCP sockets. A fun deep dive into
how the web actually works under the hood.

## What I Use
Primarily Go, but I'm decent at Rust, competent at Lua (because of Neovim), and
I've dabbled in every major language to some degree.

## About These Projects
I enjoy building things that are both technically interesting and (sometimes)
actually useful, whether that's exploring what's possible with new tech or
making developer workflows a bit smoother.

*Always happy to chat about interesting problems!*
